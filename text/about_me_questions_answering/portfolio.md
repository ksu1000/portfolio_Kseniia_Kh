# Portfolio

## 1. Introduction
This repository showcases a collection of my projects focused on **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning**, leveraging Python and TensorFlow. The work is categorized into three main areas according to the input data type: image, tabular data, and text. Below, you will find a description of these categories and completed projects. But first, let me introduce myself a little


## 3. Repository Structure

- **images/**: Projects related to image processing, computer vision models, and other works involving images as input.
- **tabular_data/**: Projects focused on analyzing tabular data, such as classification, regression, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **text/**: Projects that focus on natural language processing (NLP), such as text analysis, text classification models, etc.

## 4. Tools
- **Language**: Python
- **Main Libraries**: 
  - Pandas, NumPy (for data handling)
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
  - TensorFlow (for deep learning)
  - Scikit-learn (for ML models)
  - Transformers (Hugging Face, for state-of-the-art NLP models)
  - Optuna (for hyperparameter optimization)
